## Hi there 👋
I'm *Sebastien Le Mouillour* (aka. [Noofreuuuh](https://github.com/noofreuuuh)).

I created the Github organisation *Grasdouble* to regroup all my Github projects and to test/use Github organisation features.

You will mostly retrieve frontend projects.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - How can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
